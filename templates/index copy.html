        It's 2029.<br><br>
        You run the world's leading zero-gravity construction firm.<br><br>
        Your sole employee, Edgar, is a large language model connected to factories and launch facilities around the world. You tell him to build things and he builds them.<br><br>
        You recently scored your biggest client yet: the government of Earth. The people of Earth have decided that digging for fuel has gotten too slow and messy.<br><br>
        You and Edgar will build a power plant in outer space called a Dyson swarm, a cloud of robots that collects solar energy, concentrates it, and beams it back to Earth, providing one septillion joules of energy per year.<br><br>
        The people of Earth would appreciate a quick turnaround on this.<br><br>
        <br><br>
        You and Edgar typically start off projects in simulation mode.<br><br>
        In simulation mode, Edgar can predict with 99.98% accuracy what will happen if he carries out a given prompt.<br><br>
        <br><br>
        Don't worry if it takes a few tries to find a prompt that works.<br><br>
        <br><br>
        Go ahead and get started.<br><br>
